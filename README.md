# Digital
Digital is a website recreated in HTML and SCSS only.

## About
I wanted to recreate a design done by W3Layouts and take it as a design to website mentality. So, looked at the demo to the original theme and recreated using HMTL and SCSS. I didn't compare the two until I was finished with the webpage. After I did I noticed that the original used older methods such as floats to design the layout of the page. I opted to use CSS Flexbox and Grid to layout the page.

## Demo
